# tsbox

tsbox is an erlang library of history management and selection logic
which forms the foundation of timestamp-based transaction control.


# Scope

- Keeping timestamped history data, some versions may be conflicted
  and/or concurrent.
- Timestamp can be total ordered or partial ordered.  The outcome of
  partial ordered timestamp may lead to some annoying behavior.
  Investigatin such outcome is included in this prototype's scope.
- Supplying timestamp and preserving commit log are out of scope.
  Nonetheless very simple (and stuid) timestamp supplier and commit
  log server is inlcuded in this repository for reference/testing.

# Supposed System Description and the Responsibility of tsbox

Consider three components which communicate with each other and
maintain transacional data in coordinated manner.

1. Timestamp management
2. Timestamped (~ history) data management
3. Commit log management

## Timestamp management

Interface:

- Reply timestamp for a request.

## Timestamped data management

This library forms a part of this component.

Interface:

- Reply "current" data for a read request with a key and a timestamp.
- Receive "new" data for a write request and reply a result,
  ok/busy/conflicted.

  - ok: data is stored, no confliction
  - busy: there is already conflicted data, not storead
  - conflicted: data is storead but conflicted

- Garbage collection (TODO)

## Commit log management

Interface:

- Accept "begin transaction" request and keep it with expiring time.
- Accept "commit transaction" request and modify the state.
- Accept "rollback transaction" request and modify the state.
- Accept "force abort transaction" request and judge its validity and
  modify the state.  Only this kind of request can be issued from any
  actor, i.e. can be issued by a actor which is other than transaction
  owner.

Assumption:

- Time gap from "the absolute clock" is inside +/- `MAX_TIME_GAP`.
  We consider the case where this gap is < 5 seconds.

  TODO: VALIDITY? Can there be a actor with awfully corrupted clock?

# Transaction state transition

```
   O  --(begin)--> initialized
                      |
                      +--(commit)--> committed [final state]
                      |
                      +--(rollback)--> aborted [final state]
                      |
                      +--(timeout?)-->
                      |
                      +--(abort)--> aborted [final state]
```
